These mappability files were created for 75 100 150 kmers.\
We wanted to create separate blacklist files for (u)ChIPmentation and classic ChIP-seq datasets.\
- (u)ChIPmentation datasets have just 12 inputs (6 each from Roslin and Aberdeen)
- classic ChIP-seq datasets have 20 inputs (all 20 from NMBU)
