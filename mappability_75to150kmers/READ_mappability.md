These mappability files were created for 75 100 150 kmers using genome assembly: Ssal_v3.1 (GCA_905237065.2).\
We wanted to create separate blacklist files for (u)ChIPmentation and classic ChIP-seq datasets.\
- (u)ChIPmentation datasets have just 12 inputs (6 each from Roslin and Aberdeen)
- classic ChIP-seq datasets have 20 inputs (all 20 from NMBU)
